ATLAS require site storages to periodically provide a list of files so that they can search for dark data.  The wiki with full instructions can be found here:
https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/AtlasComputing/DDMDarkDataAndLostFiles#Automated_checks_Site_Responsibi

The specification is for a file system while ceph is an object store.  
a list of files (with relative path) from the directory tree belonging to particular DDM endpoint

For files in datadisk
surl = gsiftp://gridftp.echo.stfc.ac.uk/atlas:datadisk/rucio/data16_13TeV/ab/cd/file001.root
In the dump it will look like:
rucio/data16_13TeV/ab/cd/file001.root

This dump will be saved to:
surl = gsiftp://gridftp.echo.stfc.ac.uk/atlas:datadisk/dumps/dump_<date>
where date is of the format: YYYYMMDD

The python script will also generate the dump for scratchdisk.
